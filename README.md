# Crafter RL Project â€“ PPO & A2C Training

This project demonstrates **training and evaluating two reinforcement learning algorithms** on the [Crafter](https://github.com/danijar/crafter) environment using [Stable-Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/).

The goal is to teach students how to:
- Train an RL agent on a **Partially observable environment** 
- Test generalization on **unseen environments**.
- Compare performance across algorithms to understand **robustness and generalization**.

---

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, students should be able to:
- Configure and run **two RL algorithms** on the same environment.
- Analyze results by comparing performance across **seen** and **unseen seeds**(optional).

---

## ðŸ›  Setup

### 1. Clone the Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rayrsys/Reinforcement-Learning-Project-2026-Crafter.git
cd Crafter_Project
start coding ;)
